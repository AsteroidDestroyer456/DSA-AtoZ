AtoZ DSA: A Comprehensive Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms


Welcome to AtoZ DSA, where I aim to provide a complete resource for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository serves as a personal collection of well-structured notes, efficient code implementations, and curated problem sets, all designed to help streamline your learning and preparation for coding interviews and competitive programming.

What This Repo Offers:
Step-by-Step Progression: Topics organized from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, making it easy to follow and build your skills.
Code Implementations: Clean, efficient, and well-commented solutions in C++/Python for each data structure and algorithm, with a focus on best practices.
Practice Problems: Each section includes relevant problems for hands-on practice, with varying levels of difficulty to challenge and improve your understanding.
Comprehensive Topic Coverage:
Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
Trees, Graphs, Hashing, Heaps
Sorting and Searching Algorithms
Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
Recursion, Backtracking, Divide & Conquer
Advanced concepts like Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, and Graph Algorithms
Interview-Ready Content: Special sections focused on popular coding interview questions and problem-solving strategies.
Why I Created This:
As a passionate learner and AI/ML enthusiast, I wanted a place to consolidate my understanding of DSA while helping others along the way. This repository is for anyone who, like me, wants to master DSA from the ground up and stay sharp for technical challenges ahead.
